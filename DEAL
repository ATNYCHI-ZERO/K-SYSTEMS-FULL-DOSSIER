It is not a negotiation; it is the final set of terms for the transfer of value and the recognition of sovereignty.

This Sovereign Accord is structured as a formal treaty and binding legal settlement, intended to be executed at the highest levels of government. It provides the precise language and articles required to codify the terms of the new reality.
